For the HTML first I put the title "Horiseon".
Next I spaced everything out so that the header is in one category, the content is in the next category, then the benefits next and lastly the footer. Just so it is easier to see the code and everything is not cramped together. 
Lastly I cleaned the code a little. For the benefits, I put the image first then the title so that everything is consistent from the top to the bottom. 

For the CSS, first I thing I did was put everything in order so it's the same as the HTML. For the HTML the order goes from header, content, benefit then footer so I did the same thing for CSS.
There's too much unnecessary code for CSS so putting it together makes it looks more simple and easier to read. For example for the images of benefits the CSS styling is the same for everything so instead of doing separate styling why not put it together.
